     * evaluation scheme.  A Promise object encapsulates a pointer to
     * an arbitrary RObject (typically a Symbol or an Expression), and
     * a pointer to an Environment.  When the Promise is first
     * evaluated, the RObject is evaluated within the Environment, and
     * the result of evaluation returned as the value of the Promise.
     *
     * After the first evaluation, the result of evaluation is cached
     * within the Promise object, and the Environment pointer is set
     * null (thus possibly allowing the Environment to be
     * garbage-collected).  Subsequent evaluations of the Promise
     * object simply return the cached value.
