    /** @brief Framework for R command evaluation.
     *
     * An object of this class provides a framework within which
     * evaluation of R commands (i.e. top-level R expressions) takes
     * place, and provides various housekeeping services to control
     * and support that evaluation.  Evaluator objects conceptually
     * form a stack, so they must be destroyed in the reverse order of
     * creation: it is therefore recommended that they always be
     * declared on the processor stack, i.e. as C++ automatic
     * variables.  The Evaluator at the top of the stack is the \e
     * current Evaluator.
     *
     * If an error occurs during R expression evaluation, the
     * resulting exception is caught within the scope of the current
     * Evaluator; the relevant code will then typically request
     * another R command (if interactive), or terminate the scope of
     * the current Evaluator, thus popping it off the Evaluator stack,
     * and return control to code within the scope of the next
     * Evaluator down.
     *
     * Each Evaluator object contains a nested sequence of zero or
     * more Contexts.  A newly created Context is added to the
     * sequence belonging to the current Evaluator.  It is therefore
     * an error to declare a Context object outside the scope of any
     * Evaluator object.
     *
     * @note Evaluator objects fulfil many of the roles of TOPLEVEL
     * contexts within CR (which do not exist within rho).  Note that
     * in rho, each Evaluator has its own singly-linked list of
     * Context objects (starting with the innermost); there is no
     * overall list of Context objects spanning different Evaluator
     * objects.
